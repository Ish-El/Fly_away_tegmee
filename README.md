This repository contains placeholder content. To keep your environment secure, network access should remain disabled unless absolutely necessary.

If you need to lock down network connectivity, run the `scripts/restrict_network.sh` script with root privileges. It uses `iptables` to drop all inbound and outbound traffic. Review the script before running and modify it to suit your needs.

**Important:** Enabling internet access can expose your environment to security risks, including prompt injection, exfiltration of secrets or code, and injection of malware. Always review commands and code before executing them.
