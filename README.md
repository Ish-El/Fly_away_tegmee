# Fly Away Tegmee

This repository contains a small project that visualizes psychological traits through a plant representation. The application is located in the `ego-plant-app` directory.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ego-plant-app
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to interact with the plant visualization.

### Optional
- User responses are analyzed using a simple sentiment detector.
- The plant grows or shrinks and changes color based on the analysis result.
